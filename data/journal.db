The <strong>Housing role</strong> decides to converts <strong>two level 0 Housing blocks</strong> (black color) into <strong>level 1 Housing blocks</strong> (grey color) in the lower <strong>Urban hexagon</strong> and in the upper <strong>Urban hexagon</strong> converts one <strong>level 1 Housing block</strong> (grey color) into a <strong>level 2 Housing block</strong> (green color). The player pays a total of 800 Ƈ (200 Ƈ for each upgraded <strong>level 0 Housing block</strong>, and 400 Ƈ for the updated <strong>level 1 Housing block</strong>). He/she chooses two <strong>Housing level 1 cards</strong> and one <strong>Housing level 2 card</strong>, carefully matching them with his/her own <strong>Hidden agenda</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>Housing role</strong> then <strong>turns all dice with Food symbol</strong> into <strong>Mixed Waste</strong> (from black and grey <strong>Housing blocks</strong>) or <strong>Separated Waste</strong> (from green <strong>Housing blocks</strong>). In this case, there will be 3 <strong>Mixed Waste</strong> in the lower <strong>Urban hexagon</strong>, 2 <strong>Mixed Waste</strong> and 1 <strong>Separated Waste</strong> in the upper <strong>Urban hexagon</strong>. Finally, he/she moves <strong>three units of Mixed Waste</strong> from the upper <strong>Urban area</strong> via the grey <strong>Transportation</strong> connections to the <strong>level 0 Treatment plant</strong> (black).</p><p><em>After the housing role finishes his/her turn: three units of mixed waste remain in the lower <strong>Urban area</strong>.</em></p><p></p><img src=\"systems/reclaim/assets/Journal/fig2-housing-role.png\" /><p></p><p></p><p>Next, it is the turn of the <strong>Treatment role</strong>. This player decides to build a <strong>level 1 Treatment plant</strong> in the <strong>Rural area</strong> below the <strong>Urban areas</strong>. The player therefore flips the hexagon over, <strong>transforming the Rural area into an Urban area</strong>, before placing the <strong>Treatment plant</strong>. Then he/she builds a <strong>Mixed Waste transportation</strong> from the lower <strong>Urban area</strong> to the new <strong>Treatment plant</strong>. He/she then decides the a <strong>dump</strong> is needed for the <strong>sludge</strong>. Therefore, he/she designates a <strong>hexagon</strong> be the place to <strong>dump Sludge</strong> and builds a <strong>Road</strong> from the <strong>level 0 Treatment plant</strong> to this hexagon. He/she pays a total of 500 Ƈ (200 Ƈ for building the <strong>Treatment plant</strong>, 200 Ƈ for a <strong>Mixed Waste transportation</strong> and 100 Ƈ for building a <strong>Road</strong>). The player chooses one <strong>Treatment Level 1 card</strong>, carefully matching it to the <strong>Hidden agenda</strong>. He/she also takes one grey <strong>Transportation infrastructure card</strong> and one brown <strong>Transportation infrastructure card</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>Treatment role</strong> will then treat the <strong>waste</strong> at the <strong>Treatment plants</strong>. Two <strong>Mixed Wastes</strong> can be moved from the lower <strong>Urban area</strong> to the new <strong>Level 1 Treatment plant</strong> where they are converted into <strong>Sludge</strong> (flip the <strong>resource dice</strong> to show <strong>Sludge</strong>).</p><p><em>Note that the <strong>mixed waste</strong> from the <strong>level 0 Housing</strong> (black) cannot be moved because these houses are unimproved/unconnected.</em></p><p>The <strong>Treatment roll</strong> must then attempt to operate the existing <strong>Treatment plant</strong>. He/she will roll the <strong>Conversion dice</strong> one time for each <strong>Waste</strong> resource that should be converted by the <strong>level 0 Treatment plant</strong>. The <strong>dice</strong> shows if the <strong>Waste</strong> is converted into <strong>Sludge</strong> and remains in the hexagon, or if it is flushed through the <strong>Treatment plant</strong> and ends up as untreated <strong>Waste</strong> in the <strong>Water</strong>.</p><p><em>Note that the <strong>Separated Waste</strong> from the green <strong>level 2 Housing block</strong> was also sent to the <strong>level 0 Treatment plant</strong>. Since it was not sent to a <strong>level 2 Treatment plant</strong>, it is treated in the same way as <strong>Mixed Waste</strong>.</em></p><p>In this example, the die shows that two units end up in the river and one becomes <strong>Sludge</strong>.</p><p>If the <strong>waste</strong> becomes <strong>Sludge</strong>, they can be sent to the specified <strong>Dump hexagon</strong> (upper right corner). Alternatively, they can also be kept in the <strong>Treatment plant hexagon</strong> and later be sent to a <strong>Farm</strong>.

He/she also builds a <strong>Road</strong> between the two previous <strong>Farms</strong>. He/she pays a total of 700 Ƈ (400 Ƈ for upgrading a Farm to level 2, 200 Ƈ for building a new level 1 Farm and 100 Ƈ for a Road). He/she chooses one <strong>Farm level 1 card</strong> and one <strong>Farm level 2 card</strong>, carefully matching them to the <strong>Hidden agenda</strong>. He/she also gets one brown <strong>Transportation infrastructure card</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>Farming role</strong> converts the <strong>NPK</strong> resource by each <strong>Farm</strong> into <strong>Food</strong> and sends the two resources with <strong>Road</strong> connection to an <strong>Urban hexagon</strong>.</p><p>Note, the new <strong>level 1 Farm</strong> will also produce one <strong>Food</strong> resource, but since there is no road, that <strong>Food</strong> remains at the <strong>Farm</strong>.</p><p></p><img src=\"systems/reclaim/assets/Journal/fig4-farming-role.png\" /><p></p><p></p><p>The <strong>Independent Contractor</strong> <strong>role</strong> decides which of the other roles he/she should impersonate this round. After deciding that he/she will play as the <strong>Housing role</strong>, he/she <strong>builds a Road</strong> from the unconnected <strong>Farm</strong> to the connected one and builds a <strong>Road</strong> from the <strong>level 1 Treatment</strong> plant to the closest <strong>Farm</strong>. He/she also upgrades one <strong>level 0 Housing block</strong> into a <strong>level 1 Housing block</strong>. This cost 700 Ƈ for the <strong>Contractor role,</strong> since costs are higher than for the others (400 Ƈ for 2 Roads and 300 Ƈ for upgrading a <strong>Housing block</strong>). He/she chooses one <strong>Housing Level 1 card,</strong> carefully matching it to the <strong>Hidden agenda</strong>. He/she also gets <strong>two brown Transportation infrastructure cards</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>Independent Contractor</strong> can perform any resource conversion and transportation if they performed an action connected to that resource/infrastructure. Thus, the player can <strong>move</strong> one unit of <strong>Food</strong> from the <strong>level 1 Farm</strong> to an <strong>Urban area</strong>.</p><p></p><img src=\"systems/reclaim/assets/Journal/fig5-independent-contractor-role.png\" /><p></p><p>On the board, there are now 3 <strong>Food</strong> resources in one <strong>Urban hexagon</strong>, 2 <strong>Sludge</strong> resources at the <strong>Level 1 Treatment plant</strong>, 1 <strong>Sludge</strong> resource on the <strong>Dump hexagon</strong> and 2 <strong>Mixed Waste</strong> units in the <strong>Water hexagon</strong>.</p><p></p><div><div><div><div><h3>The players play together</h3><p>The players now have to make joint decisions about the game. They count the number of <strong>Food</strong> resources and realize that they need to <strong>import 3 Food</strong> resources to make sure every <strong>Housing block</strong> has access to <strong>Food</strong> (cost of 100 Ƈ each – so total 300 Ƈ). There is 1 <strong>untreated Waste</strong> in the city which creates a risk of <strong>disease</strong> if it is not dumped in the <strong>Water hexagon</strong>. The players do not want to dump, so they take a risk and roll the <strong>Disease Dice</strong>.</p><p>In this example, they are lucky and the <strong>Waste does not turn into Disease</strong>. Therefore, there is no disease on the board and <strong>no need for Vaccination</strong>.</p><p>Since the <strong>City budget</strong> still has 200 Ƈ, the players decide that they will import 2 units of <strong>NPK</strong> in preparation for the next round. <strong>NPK</strong> cost only 100 Ƈ each this round.</p></div><img src=\"systems/reclaim/assets/Journal/fig6-end-tutorial.png\" /></div></div></div><p></p><p></p><h3>The Game plays</h3><p>There are 2 units of <strong>Mixed Waste</strong> in the river, it is not good but “ok for now”, we don’t have to roll the <strong>Disease</strong> dice.</p><p>There is no <strong>Disease</strong> on the board, which means the players don’t lose.</p><p>There is 1 <strong>Food</strong> resource per <strong>Housing area</strong>, which is good.</p><p>The players have survived the first round.
